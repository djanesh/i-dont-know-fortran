# Compiling errors

* The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000018). Click Ok to close 
the application. This question is also referred in [StackOverflow](https://superuser.com/questions/610495/the-application-was-unable-to-start-correctly-0xc0000018-windows-8-x64)
* I tried the solution in superuser and the accepted solution solved my issue. 

* If we get error such as This Hollerith or character constant is too long and 
cannot be used in the current numeric context.   ['UNIQUE'] then we will get the
link error in visual studio. The LNKerror 1120 can be fixed by declaring the 
variable. Click on F12 to look at the definition. If by clicking F12 nothing 
happens, that means that variable is not declared. 

* Unexpected PDB error, RPC(23) (0x000006BA) with Intel Fortran

I encountered this error when I created a new project using visual studio and compiled 
the code with the default source code file that was created by Visual Studio / Intel 
Visual Fortran. After I deleted that source file and recompiled, the error is 
gone. So, it is important to delete the default source code that is generated 
by Visual studio / Intel Visual fortran.
