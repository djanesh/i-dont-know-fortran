# Introduction 

Welcome to I don't know Fortran Series. This notebook is generated by my daily use in Fortran for past several years. Sometimes 
we are stuck in simple things in Fortran. This book gives a guide on using basic things / functions in Fortran. 

Disclaimer: Most of the syntax described here works in intel fortran. I haven't tested on other versions of Fortran. 

# Structures in fortran
## Logical operators 

There are 5 logical operators in Fortran. They are: 

1. `.NOT.`
2. `.OR.`
3. `.AND.`
4. `.EQV.`
5. `.NEQV.`

`.NOT.` is the highest  `.OR.` and `.AND.`, `.EQV.` and `.NEQV.` are the lowest.

## If structure

```
IF (logical-expression-1) THEN
statement sequence 1
ELSE IF (logical-expression-2) THEN
statement seqence 2
ELSE IF (logical-expression-3) THEN
statement sequence statement sequence 3
ELSE IF (.....) THEN
...........
ELSE
10 statement sequence ELSE END IF 
```
